## Assignment 2

The implementation is in the assignment2.ipynb notebook. The libraries required to run the notebook as well as instructions on how to run the notebook are listed below.

#### Install required libraries

The following packages must be installed to run the assignment notebook

 - gensim
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - huggingface_hub
 - EbookLib
 - beautifulsoup4
 - nltk

#### How to run

After installing the required packages:  
 - ensure that the A2 dataset is in a folder named A2-DataSet and that it contains the synonym.csv file.
 - if you want to run the entire notebook, you will need a directory named Books that contains all the books you need for task 3. Otherwise, you can run the cells individually and when you reach Task 3, skip the section that preprocesses the books and instead start Task 3 with the cell where you load the sentences list from the sentences.json file. This file contains the preprocessed sentences and is included with the rest of the files.
 - the code for all the tasks is in the assignment.ipynb file.
